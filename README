== Welcome to WebCMS

This CMS is based on the refineryCMS (at least the user interface is).
I decided to start with a new Rails 3 app that would be able to host multiple clients on one running rails app.

Please have a look at the refineryCMS because this cms is still in heavy development!

What is possible at the moment:
- add, remove, edit clients
	You can specify what:
		- name
		- domain name
		- if the client is active or not
		- Upload a zip with which contains the html, css, images, flash etc.
			The zip will be copied to /website/:client_id/ and extracted there. 
			The zip will be deleted after being extracted.
- add, remove, edit galleries
	You can only specify what the name of that gallery should be. 
	Galleries are automatically coupled to a client.
	
- add, remove, sort images. You can also change the gallery an image is associated with. 
	You can upload up to 5 images at a time with SWFUpload.
	Images can be reordered by drag and drop. 
	Images can change gallery by drag and drop. 
	Image can be deleted by drag and drop.

- add, remove, edit, sort pages.
	You can specify the name of a "menu item" (page).
	Pages can be reordered by drag and drop. 
	A Page can change parent by drag and drop. 

TO DO ------ 
	- add, remove, edit, sort content items (like images, galleries, articles etc.) 
	- add, remove, edit user groups.
	- add, remove, edit users. Also be able change groups association.
	
This CMS has the "DON't bother me with it" license. And is free to be used for any purpose. 
The software is provided "as is" and there is NO guaranty that it is save, useful or whatever.

As i said earlier. THis cms is still in heavy development!
