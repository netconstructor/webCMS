== Welcome to WebCMS

This CMS is based on the refineryCMS (at least the user interface is).
I decided to start with a new Rails 3 app that would be able to have multi-tenanted hosting capabilities.

Please have a look at the refineryCMS because this cms is still in heavy development (and probably doesn't suit your need (yet))!
having said that:
What is possible at the moment:
- add, remove, edit clients
	You can specify what:
		- name
		- domain name
		- if the client is active or not
		- Upload a zip with which contains the html, css, images, flash etc.
			The zip will be copied to /website/:client_id/ and extracted there. 
			The zip will be deleted after being extracted.
- add, remove, edit galleries
	You can only specify what the name of that gallery should be. 
	Galleries are automatically coupled to a client.
	
- add, remove, sort images. You can also change the gallery an image is associated with. 
	You can upload up to 5 images at a time with SWFUpload.
	Images can be reordered by drag and drop. 
	Images can change gallery by drag and drop. 
	Image can be deleted by drag and drop.

- add, remove, edit, sort pages.
	You can specify the name of a "menu item" (page).
	Pages can be reordered by drag and drop. 
	A Page can change parent by drag and drop. 
	
- add, remove, edit, sort content items.
	Content items can be a Article, gallery or youtube video
	Content items can be reordered by drag and drop

- add, remove, edit groups.
	Groups can be edited, created and assigned to pages (this way users in a group can login on a website and see those item)
	Groups can be admin (then they have cms access)
	
- add, remove, edit users.
	Users can be dragged into groups.
	Users can be deleted by drag and drop.
	
- add, remove, edit youtube movies by giving the url of a youtube clip
	
- add and remove plugins for each clients. 
	Possible to create a "settings.yml" file and specify which plugins
	a client can use (also in which order)
	
- add and remove features for each client
	Possible to create a "settings.yml" file and specify which features a client can
	access, based on the plugins a client can use.
	
	
TO DO ------ 
	- Update the Article plugin for adding, editting Links
	- Update the Article plugin for adding, editting images
